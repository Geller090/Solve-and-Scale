## DESIGN OPTION 1: CENTERED LAYOUT
A clean, centered design with elements stacked vertically:
- Orange upward trending arrow at the top center (similar to favicon)
- "SOLVE AND SCALE" text logo below the arrow (large, bold)
- "Strategy, Systems, and Marketing" tagline below the logo

## DESIGN OPTION 2: GRID LAYOUT
A more dynamic layout with elements arranged horizontally:
- Orange arrow on the left side (40% of width)
- Text block on the right (60% of width):
  * "SOLVE AND SCALE" text logo (large, bold)
  * "Strategy, Systems, and Marketing" tagline
  * Optional additional line: "Helping businesses get unstuck — and grow with clarity."

## DESIGN NOTES
- The arrow should have a slight 3D effect with shadow on one side
- Add subtle shadow behind text for better visibility
- Use high contrast for readability when shared
- Keep critical elements away from edges (60-80px safe zone)
- Test how it looks at both large and thumbnail sizes
